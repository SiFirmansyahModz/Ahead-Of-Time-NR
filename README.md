AOT stands for Ahead-of-Time, which is the compilation method used by the Android Runtime (ART) in the Android operating system

In the AOT compilation method, the application code is compiled into native machine code before the application is executed. This differs from the Just-in-Time (JIT) method, where the code is compiled into machine code while the application is running
